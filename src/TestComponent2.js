/*
The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.

It allows for custom state logic.

If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.

useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)


State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.

To illustrate, we have many nested components. The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.

To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component. This is called "prop drilling".
